# Slice of Life 
Slice of Life is a tool to organize, analyze, and plot data by splitting it up into time slices.
This is the first iteration of this program, and was developed specifically to analyze the flow of
patients through different care segments in an emergency department by utilizing traffic flow
theory.

## What does it do?
Given a .csv file with at least two columns of time data, the program can sort these lines into
user defined time periods (slices). For each time slice, there is an associated measure of flux,
density, and mean length of stay which is all put into an output .csv file. It can then sort 
these output files by time of day, and provide summary statistics and plots to give the user
an idea of how the flow of patients changes throughout the day.

## Dependencies
anaconda with python version 3.4 or above

## Data input requirements
